# elixr

Elixr's aim is to promote a healthy physical and financial lifestyle, and incentivize users to improve these areas with rewards. We analyze each user's transaction history, and offer a list of goals that promote financial, mental, or physical wellbeing.
These range from ensuring the user has kept up with their investments, to making sure you've been walking and exercising often. If you complete these goals, you get points, that you can spend on relevant rewards, such as percent cash back, or wellness prizes!
